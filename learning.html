<h3>Designing a Vehicle That Reflects School Pride</h3>
<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the competition was designing the team’s electric vehicle.  The Bufori EViE car challenge sponsor chose a blue and white colour scheme, inspired by the official colours of Kian Kok Middle School. The design symbolized the team’s school spirit, unity, and identity, creating a vehicle that truly represented who they are as a school community.</p>
<p>The car was not only visually striking but also engineered with performance, efficiency, and sustainability in mind. Every member of the team contributed ideas, from optimizing aerodynamics to ensuring the vehicle’s energy efficiency, demonstrating creativity and technical understanding.</p>
<p>“Our car represents our school and our vision: moving forward together with pride, innovation, and responsibility,” said Sean Chew. </p>

<h3>Promoting a Global Mission: Renewable Energy and Environmental Protection</h3>
<p>Unit 1’s participation in the Bufori EViE Car Challenge is deeply rooted in a strong environmental mission. With climate change and pollution becoming urgent global issues, the team is committed to advocating renewable energy solutions and promoting the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).</p>
<p>The team’s goals include:</p>
<p>• Raising awareness about the environmental impact of traditional fuel-powered vehicles</p>
<p>• Encouraging sustainable innovation among young people</p>
<p>• Demonstrating the potential of renewable energy in everyday life</p>
<p>• Inspiring action towards a greener planet</p>
<p>“We hope our project shows that even students can make a meaningful difference in the world,” said Liaw Yi Xuan. </p>
<p>“If we all take steps towards using renewable energy, no matter how small, we can collectively protect our planet,” said Lee Jia Xuan.</p>
<p>The Bufori EViE Car Challenge gave students a tangible way to contribute to environmental solutions, showing that innovation and responsibility</p>

<h3>Learning Through Experience: Innovation, Teamwork, and Problem-Solving</h3>
<p>Participation in the challenge was an incredible learning experience. The students were exposed to real-world engineering problems, technological design, and sustainability concepts. </p>
<p> They gained practical skills in:</p>
<p>• Vehicle design and engineering principles</p>
<p>• Energy efficiency and renewable energy application</p>
<p>• Critical thinking and problem-solving under pressure</p>
<p>• Collaboration and leadership</p>
<p>• Presentation and communication of technical idea</p>
<p>The competition also encouraged creativity and experimentation. Students learned that failure is not the end, but an opportunity to improve, adapt, and innovate — lessons that extend far beyond the classroom.
<p>“We discovered that learning through doing is much more powerful than simply reading about science,” said Jia Jun .</p>
<p>“Each challenge made us more confident, more curious, and more determined to create solutions that matter,” said Jia Hui. </p>
