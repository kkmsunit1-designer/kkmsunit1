<section><h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>The success of Unit 1 can be attributed to its strong leadership and unwavering dedication. The team was guided by Teacher Bobby, whose mentorship, encouragement, and technical guidance ensured that the students stayed focused, organized, and motivated throughout the project.</p>
<p>Leading the students on the ground were:</p>
    <p>•	Team Captain: Skyler</p>
	<p>•	Vice Captain: Fung Sung Tze</p>
<p>“This competition is about more than just building a car; it’s about shaping responsible innovators who care for the planet,” said Teacher Bobby.</p>
<p>Skyler, the team captain, shared,</p>
<p>“We learned that true leadership is about bringing people together, listening to ideas, and motivating everyone to give their best. Our success is a shared achievement.”</p>
<p>Vice Captain Fung Sung Tze added,</p>
<p>“Every challenge we faced — from design hurdles to technical problems — taught us that teamwork and perseverance are just as important as innovation.”</p>
<p>
Through this collaboration, the students developed essential skills in communication, problem-solving, and project management, preparing them for future challenges both in school and beyond.</p>
